# basex - A BaseX client for node.js  
===========================

This is a [BaseX](http://basex.org/) client for Node.js. It is work in progress. 
It uses the [client interface](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Server_Protocol)
 via a socket connection to the BaseX server.

BaseX is a very light-weight, high-performance and scalable
 XML Database engine and XPath/XQuery 3.0 Processor, 
 including full support for the W3C Update and Full Text extensions.
Built as a lightweight Java server, BaseX also supports XSLT, Webdav and RestXQ.  

## Installing the BaseX Node client
